###### Below is a .gif and link to my random password generator. I researched a bunch of ways that others built password generators. Using that data as well as my own knowledge of javascript I created this one. This is different than most because you are given a prompt which asks your character and length specifications. Then the password is generated based off of the chosen length and character choice. The password contains at least one of each specified character (user choice). Then the created password is shuffled to insure that the password is in fact 100% random. Enjoy!
